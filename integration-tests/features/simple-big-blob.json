Available models include clinical history and molecular characterization information so investigators can select models best fit to their research.

The Cas9 induces double strand breaks which lead to false-positive results. A computational method, CERES was developed for inferring gene essentiality from genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in cancer cell lines to correct the copy number effect. This approach decreases the false-positive results while taking into account the anti-proliferative copy-number effect.</p>",

To negate this problem, MARINa uses the transcriptional targets of each TF as a multiplexed reporter assay to infer the TFs controlling the transition between cellular phenotypes. This task is performed by computing the effect that enrichment of each regulon (i.e., its activated and repressed targets) has on the differentially expressed genes between two phenotypic states.</p>",

In addition, a control collection of clones as part of the \"Genetic Pathway Reference Set\" provides a resource to generate benchmark perturbation data. These plasmids are collectively called the Broad Target Accelerator Plasmid Collections. The design and construction of these plasmids is described in the manuscripts and they are available through a distributor.</p>",

Typically, the user will create a separate library for each data file that he or she uses. A library can be saved to disk, then loaded whenever the corresponding data file is used.\nOnce a library of variables has been created (or loaded from removable media), the user may define a model. IRAP supports six data sampling methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple Random Sampling</li>\n<li>Stratified Random Sampling</li>\n<li>Frequency Matching</li>\n<li>Individual Matching</li>\n<li>Cohort Analysis</li>\n<li>Cross-Sectional Analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After choosing the appropriate sampling method, the user defines a model by specifying the appropriate variable names. A model can contain both discrete and continuous variables. IRAP correctly parameterizes the discrete variables, so the user need not explicitly create \"dummy variables.\"\nOnce the model has been specified, the user tells IRAP to fit the model. The program asks for the names of the input and output files. It then reads the data and fits the model.\nWhile these three phases are conceptually distinct, they can be interwoven. For example, after fitting a model, the user may decide to combine two levels of exposure into one. It is easy to define a new variable, then rerun the model, substituting the new exposure variable for the old.</p>",

In each cycle, TUS-CPS collects nationally representative data from about 240,000 adults (data collected between 1992-2006 also included youth ages 15-17). About two-thirds of respondents complete the questionnaire by telephone and responses for the remaining third are obtained through in-person interviews. The survey is regularly conducted in English and Spanish, and other languages when needed. These data can be used by researchers to monitor tobacco control progress, conduct tobacco-related research, including tobacco health disparities, and evaluate tobacco control programs.</p>",

Splice site mutations in cancer are most frequently observed as inactivating alterations in tumor suppressor genes (e.g., <em>TP53</em> or <em>RB1</em>) and to a lesser degree as activating alterations in oncogenes (e.g., <em>MET</em>). Interpreting the consequences of a specific splice site variant is not straightforward, especially if the variant is located outside of the canonical splice sites. Accurate interpretation of a splice site mutation’s impact can further our understanding of biology, influence patient treatment, and in case of germline splice site variants, may have relevance to familial disease predisposition. To facilitate the interpretation of splice site variant effects, the Biometric Research Program’s Computational and Systems Biology Branch developed MutSpliceDB: a database of splice sites variants, documenting variants effect(s) on splicing based on RNA-seq BAM files from sample(s) with splice site variants.</p>",

Each sample is provided in the amount of 10 micrograms in a volume of 2 microliters (5 mg/ml) dissolved in DMSO. The fractions are mixtures of natural compounds from plants, marine organisms, and microbes purified by reversed-phase chromatography to provide fractions with better assay performance and simpler subsequent compound isolation. The NPNPD fraction library is expected to grow to a total size of around 1,000,000 fractions by 2024. New sets of fractions will be available each year. Fractions are provided free to laboratories for screening against all disease states. Recipients will be expected to pay for the cost of shipping.</p>",
