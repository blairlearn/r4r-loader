It can be challenging for researchers to choose the most appropriate measures of childhood obesity for their work. To address this need, the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research began the Measures Registry User Guides to provide an overview of measurement, describe general principles of measurement selection, present case studies that walk users through the process of using the Measures Registry to select appropriate measures, and direct researchers to additional resources. The User Guides will help move the field forward by fostering more consistent use of measures, which will allow for standardization, meta-analyses, and synthesis. NCI staff are the projects leads for the development and maintenance of the User Guides.
