The CanStat Animator allows users to animate cancer trends over time by cancer site and cause of death, race and sex. Users can select the type of statistic and the variables to be shown in the graph, select the format of the graph by choosing from various graph options, and extract the statistics in a delimited format for further analyses using other software. The CanStat Animator provides access to: SEER Incidence for 1975-2014 for the SEER 9 registries; US Mortality for 1975-2014 for the entire United States; and relative survival for 1975-2013 for the SEER 9 registries.
