CLASS can help researchers, policy makers, and schools monitor, classify, and evaluate the strength of school physical activity and nutrition policies across states and over time. Scores may also be used in larger evaluation studies to examine the relationship of state laws with student behavioral and school environment outcomes. CLASS data can be used to  compare codified state laws in nutrition and physical education to national standards; examine laws within and across grade levels; link the data with other surveillance, health, and education data sets; assess differences in codified state laws in nutrition and physical education across states over time; and  evaluate factors associated with implementation of laws.
