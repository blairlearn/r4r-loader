The CTD^2 Network aims to understand tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance for the development of efficient strategies to identify optimal combinations of small molecules or immunotherapy with small molecules. The CTD^2 Data Portal provides access to raw and analyzed primary data generated from different types of approaches, e.g., chemical genetics (small molecules, natural products), genome-wide gain-of-function (cDNA expression libraries, CRISPR activation), genome-wide loss-of-function (siRNA, shRNA, CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR interference), proteinâ€“protein interactions, and in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies.
