Limited-duration prevalence represents the proportion of people alive on a certain day who had a diagnosis of the disease within a certain number of years. The ProjPrev software takes limited-duration prevalence statistics from SEER\*Stat and applies them to a different population. The population would typically differ in year or geographic area. ProjPrev is primarily used to derive US prevalence by projecting SEER prevalence onto US populations.
