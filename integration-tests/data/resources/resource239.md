The consortiumâ€™s mission is to engage the metabolomics community to communicate and promote the development, dissemination, and harmonization of best QA/QC practices in untargeted metabolomics by identifying, cataloging, harmonizing, and disseminating best practices for untargeted metabolomics; establishing mechanisms to enable the metabolomics community to adopt QA/QC best practices; promoting and supporting systematic training in QA/QC best practices for the metabolomics community; and encouraging the prioritization and development of reference materials applicable to metabolomics research.
