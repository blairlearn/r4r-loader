Methods to measure protein abundance on a proteome-wide scale using arrays or mass spectrometry technologies cover only a fraction of proteins, requiring large amounts of tissue, and do not directly capture protein activity. The VIPER algorithm uses the transcripts most directly affected by proteinâ€™s activityto rank relative protein activity on a sample-by-sample  basis by transforming a gene expression matrix into a protein activity matrix.
