The Youth Compendium of Physical Activities, available in English, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese, provides a list of 196 common activities in which youth participate and the estimated energy cost associated with each activity. The tool can be used to summarize energy expenditures from diverse activities reported in physical activity questionnaires, contribute to the design of physical activity interventions via the selection of physiologically comparable programmatic elements, help in the design of fitness programs, and aid in the comparison and evaluation of school- and community-based programs and activities.
