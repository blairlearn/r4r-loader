The CTD^2 Dashboard compiles the CTD^2 Network-generated conclusions, or “observations,” associated with a specific gene, cell line, animal model, or perturbagen. It provides supporting evidence with links to data, references, and to the validation strength of the evidence. Data is generated from multiple types of biological and analytical approaches used by CTD^2 centers. The dashboard allows easy navigation to a broad range  of computational and non-computational scientists.
