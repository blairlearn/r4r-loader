The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) maintains a repository of synthetic compounds and pure natural products that are available to investigators for non-clinical research purposes. The repository collection is a uniquely diverse set of more than 200,000 compounds that have been either submitted to DTP for biological evaluation or, in some cases, synthesized under DTP auspices.
