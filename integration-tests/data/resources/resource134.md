CGCI Data Matrix contains whole-genome and transcriptomic sequencing from Burkitt lymphoma, HIV- associated tumors, medulloblastoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma types of cancers. Researchers can access up to four levels of data, from primary through higher level summary data for the molecular platform employed. To protect the privacy of patients, some clinical and genetic data require approval to access through NCBIâ€™s database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP; <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap>).
