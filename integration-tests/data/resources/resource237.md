Between 2008 and 2010, NICHD led a Pediatric Terminology Harmonization Initiative that successfully harmonized child life stages from six primary sources and established several agreed sets of standard coding terminology. A second harmonization project integrated over 2,000 unique terms used by three neonatal research networks.

In 2013, a collaborative effort began between NICHD, NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS), and outside experts in their fields to define the areas of Pediatric Adverse Events, Perinatology, Pediatric Rheumatology, Pediatric Endocrinology, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, and Pediatric Oncology.
In addition, the Pediatric Terminology project has decided to adopt as part of the Pediatric Terminology standard three Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) terminology standards for the coding of anatomical locations, directionality, and laterality.

Pediatric Terminology sets are developed, updated, and published monthly by NCI EVS.
