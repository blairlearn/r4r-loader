NCI agent formulary (NCI Formulary) is designed to expand the use of NCI Formulary pharmaceutical company collaborator proprietary agents for preclinical research or clinical trials and improve the clinical trial implementation process. Investigators from eligible institutions may submit proposals using the available NCI Formulary agents to conduct preclinical research or conduct investigator-sponsored clinical trials. The NCI Formulary is particularly useful to investigators who would like to perform combination studies that focus on agents targeting molecular pathways from multiple collaborating pharmaceutical companies.
