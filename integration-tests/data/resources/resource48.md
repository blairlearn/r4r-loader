title: BRB-Seq Tools
description: >
    BRB-SeqTools is a user-friendly pipeline tool that includes many well-known software applications designed to help general scientists preprocess and analyze Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. It supports the importing and preprocessing of both RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq data, in either FASTQ or BAM file format.

BRB-SeqTools can run in the Linux environment on local physical/virtual machines or on remote servers such as Amazon Cloud. Variant-calling analysis can be conducted on both aligned RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq data using Samtools or GATK  Best-Practices pipeline tools. For human tumor data, the Variant Call Format (VCF) files generated by the variant-calling pipeline can be filtered and annotated using the somatic mutation annotation tools ANNOVAR or SnpEff to provide gene annotation,  an functional annotation , along with predicted effects of non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants calculated by SIFT and Polyphen-2. Additionally, for RNA-Seq data, gene-level raw count data files can be generated using HTSeq. The raw count data can be read into BRB-ArrayTools for gene expression analysis.
