title: NCI-60 Growth inhibition Data
description: >
    Compound sensitivity data for the NCI-60 production screen that includes single concentration triage and 5 concentration response data for compounds and biologics submitted by external investigators. The NCI-60 screen includes the 60 best-characterized human tumor cell lines with a 48 hour exposure and SRB endpoint.

This resource provides access to compound and biologics submission and response data for the NCI-60 screen. The NCI-60 screen has been a free resouce available to all investigators to test new compounds with potential anticancer activity. The compounds are submitted through a registration website and data are returned to the investigator. Hundreds of peer-reviewed publications have included NCI-60 screen data. Reviews of this resource include [Nat Rev Cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16990858). 2006 Oct;6(10):813-23. These cell lines have been molecularly characterized in detail, including gene expression, mutations and other DNA alterations, protein expression, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression.
