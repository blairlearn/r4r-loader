title: Grid-Enabled Measures Database (GEM)
description: >
  GEM is a dynamic, web-based tool of behavioral and social science measures organized by theoretical constructs. GEM enables researchers to evaluate and use common measures and exchange harmonized data.

GEM allows researchers to search for a construct (e.g., anxiety, depression), see a definition of the construct, view its associated theoretical foundation, and download different measures of the construct. Similarly, researchers can search for a measure and see attributes of that measure (e.g., definition, target population, author, reliability, validity), including the associated construct. GEM also allows researchers to add new information using Web 2.0 functionality. Based upon a "wiki‚Äù platform, researchers help build the website by adding and editing measures and constructs and providing feedback and ratings. Researchers can also receive usage statistics about measures to help decide which measure to use in prospective research.
