The HEI is a measure of diet quality, independent of quantity, that can be used to assess compliance with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans and monitor changes in dietary patterns. The HEI also is a valuable tool for epidemiologic and economic research and can be used to evaluate nutrition interventions and consumer nutrition education programs. The HEIâ€“2015 is the latest iteration of the HEI. The original HEI was released by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1995. Changes made to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have necessitated revisions to the original HEI. The HEI has been significantly updated through a collaboration with the USDA and NCI.
