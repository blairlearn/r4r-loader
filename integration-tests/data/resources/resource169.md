"RadRAT is an online calculator for estimating the lifetime risk of cancer incidence for members of the U.S. population (or countries with similar cancer incidence rates) from exposure to ionizing radiation for doses below 1 Gy.&mdash;The calculator works using organ-specific dose estimates according to age at exposure and sex. Lifetime total cancer risk and organ-specific risk estimates are reported along with a 90% uncertainty range.&mdash;The reported lifetime risks are based on the risk models for the eleven cancers included in the 2006 report of the National Academies of Sciences' BEIR VII Committee, *Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation*, and on the risk models for an additional eight cancers that were, developed by NCI after the publication of the BEIR VII report."
