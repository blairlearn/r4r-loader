Depending on user preference, the probability may be calculated either from birth (lifetime risk) or for a person who is a particular age. DevCan uses Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to calculate incidence and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Nationaal Center for Health Statistics data to calculate mortality. This is a PC-based software. The current version supports rate editing, sensitivity analysis, user-defined databases, confidence intervals, and the ability to get risk estimates from any age to any age.
