This protocol provides evidence-based guidance for the proper snap-freezing of human tissue biospecimens. This guidance is intended to support the development and execution of evidence-based Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for human biospecimen collection, processing, and storage operations. It is applicable to all human tissues that are to be preserved by snap-freezing. Biospecimens preserved under these procedural guidelines are suitable for downstream analysis of DNA, RNA, protein, and morphology endpoints. Additional analytical endpoints, including but not limited to cell viability, cell sorting, drug sensitivity testing, or use as donor specimens for xenografts or primary tissue culture, do not fall within the scope of this document.
