This site hosts web-accessible applications, tools, and data designed to support analysis, management, and exploration of whole slide tissue images for cancer research. QUIP includes the following tools:

caMicroscope: A digital pathology data management and visualization plaform that enables interactive viewing of whole slide tissue images and segmentation results. caMicroscope can be also used independently of QUIP.

FeatureExplorer: An interactive tool to allow patient-level feature exploration across multiple dimensions.

FeatureScape: A visual analytics platform for exploring imaging features generated by analysis of whole slide tissue images.
