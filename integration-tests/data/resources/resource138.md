Numerous gene mutations give proteins new capabilities to bind cellular proteins and create new signaling pathways that drive tumor growth. The CTD^2 center at Emory University has created PPI expression vector libraries to discover and validate mutation-created PPIs as therapeutic targets for cancer.
