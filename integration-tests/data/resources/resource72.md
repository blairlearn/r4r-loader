NCI has created a centralized, controlled-access database, called the NCTN/NCORP Data Archive, for storing and sharing datasets generated from clinical trials of the NCTN to make these datasets available in a timely manner, on appropriate terms and conditions, to researchers who wish to analyze the data in secondary studies to enhance the public health benefit of the original work.
