title: Modular Analysis of Gene Networks In Cancer (MAGNETIC)
description: >
  A bioinformatic approach that integrates multi-omic cancer patient data with pharmacogenomic data from cell lines. This tool could be used to improve the development of biomarkers of therapeutic responses.

MAGNETIC integrates data across molecular profiling platforms (e.g., somatic mutations, copy-number alterations, gene methylation, transcriptomes, proteomes, etc.) and performs functional network analysis to identify gene networks (modules) that are preserved in both cancer patients and cell lines. These modules connect tumor genotype to therapy and could be used for biomarker discovery.
