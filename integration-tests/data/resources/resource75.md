AMARETTO is for multi-omics data fusion and reformulations for pan-etiology and pan-cancer applications. AMARETTO is an algorithm that integrates copy number, DNA methylation, and gene expression data to identify a set of driver genes by analyzing cancer samples and connects them to clusters of co-expressed genes.
