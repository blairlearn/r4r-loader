A community conversation resulted in a consensus *RAS* pathway comprising 180 genes. Plasmids contain the isoform of each gene that is most prevalent across 30 human cancers in a Gateway-compatible vector in both stop and no-stop versions.  Plasmids may be purchased from Addgene singly or as a set (N=360).
