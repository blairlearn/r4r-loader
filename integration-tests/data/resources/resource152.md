CTD2 researchers at the Broad Institute/DFCI have developed a collection of plasmids including mutant alleles found in sequencing studies of cancer. It includes somatic variants found in lung adenocarcinoma and across other cancer types. The clones enable researchers to characterize the function of the cancer variants in a high throughput experiments. In addition, a control collection of clones as part of the "Genetic Pathway Reference Set" provides a resource to generate benchmark perturbation data. These plasmids are collectively called the Broad Target Accelerator Plasmid Collections. The design and construction of these plasmids is described in the manuscripts and they are available through a distributor.
