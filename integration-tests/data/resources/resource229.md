CDAS is a website to request data recorded from various research studies, including NLST, PLCO, and the Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP. For some studies, you may also request images or biospecimens.

CDAS provides extensive public documentation for each study, including a trial summary, an overview of the data collected, and a searchable database of research projects and publications.

Researchers interested in obtaining study data may begin a CDAS project for that study. All projects are reviewed by NCI trial leadership.
