title: NCI Specimen Resource Locator (SRL)
description: >
   The SRL is a biospecimen resource database designed to help researchers locate resources that may have the samples needed for their investigational use. This publicly searchable database includes information about biospecimen banks and sample procurement services. The specimens and samples come from non-commercial, NCI- or non-NCI-funded resources. Investigators can search the database and gain access to thousands of specimens of various tumor, organ, and preservation methods. In the event a user is unsuccessful in finding the appropriate specimen resource, he or she may contact the NCI Tissue Expediter, a scientist who can further assist them. Also, the Tissue Expediter can assist researchers to identify potential collaborators when needed. The NCI and the NCI's SRL do not oversee or take responsibility for the content, quality or data of the specimen collections or resources participating in the SRL.
