Diets containing substantial amounts of red meat may increase the risk of various types of cancer. The association with red meat intake may be due to a combination of factors, such as content of fat, protein, and iron, and/or meat preparation (e.g. cooking or preserving methods). Experimental studies have shown that meats cooked at high temperatures contain heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are mutagenic and carcinogenic in animals. To estimate intake of these meat-cooking mutagens, a detailed meat cooking module within a Food Frequency Questionnaire in conjunction with a mutagen database was developed. Charred is a software application to estimate intake of the mutagenic compounds in cooked meats.
