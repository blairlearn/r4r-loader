The GDC is a research program with a mission to provide the cancer research community with a unified data repository that enables data sharing across cancer genomic studies in support of precision medicine. GDC provides harmonized DNA and RNA sequencing data and other high-quality biospecimen, clinical, and molecular data. Web-based tools supporting fine-grained queries and advanced visualization and pipelines generating DNA sequence variants, mutation analyses, expression analyses, and more are also accessible.
