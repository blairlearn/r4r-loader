title: DEMETER2
description: >
  DEMETER2 is a computation method that estimates gene dependencies by integrating data from large-scale RNAi screens (targeting up to the whole transcriptome) with read-out of cell viabilities performed in cancer cell lines. This method infers gene dependency estimates and allows for corrections to eliminate batch effects and confounders due to gene amplifications.
