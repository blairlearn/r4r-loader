This library of SOPs addresses various biobanking practices used in initiatives such as the Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB). The caHUB has collected high quality biospecimens and associated data to enable genomic research in the GTEx project, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund initiative. The success of GTEx depends on the ability to successfully procure and store high quality biospecimens for analysis. Successful collection of normal human biospecimens from rapid autopsies and organ donors requires complex operations and a stringent quality assurance and control process. For this reason, caHUB has created a large number of SOPs to govern operations in ethical and regulatory procedures; biospecimen collecting and tracking; data collection; production of collection and shipping kits and checklists; and pathology review.
