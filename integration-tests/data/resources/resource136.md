The CTD^2 center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has developed a high-throughput mutagenesis and molecular barcoding (HiTMMoB)   pipeline to construct mutant alleles open reading frame expression clones that are either found in recurrent cancer or are rare in cancers. These barcoded genes can be used for context-specific functional validation, detection of novel biomarkers (pathway activation), and targets (drug sensitivity).
