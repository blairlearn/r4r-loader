This downloadable file provides an easy to use, fast compiled C program that runs in a DOS window for computing optimal and minimax two-stage designs for phase II clinical trials. The program is based on the paper by [R. Simon: "Optimal two stage designs for phase II clinical trials", Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10, 1989](https://brb.nci.nih.gov/techreport/Optimal2-StageDesigns.pdf). To use the program, open a DOS window using the command prompt menu item in your start menu. CD to the directory into which you have put the file, and execute it.
