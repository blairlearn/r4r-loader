Head\*Bang PC is non-parametric smoothing software for the analysis of spatial (geographic) patterns of cancer. The Head-Bang PC Software was developed to reveal underlying geographic patterns in data where the values to be smoothed do not have equal variances. Head-Bang 4.0 (64-bit only) was released in May 2017 and can be used both in Windows and as a console version.
