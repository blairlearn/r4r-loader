NCI's Dietary Assessment Primer enables researchers to choose the most appropriate self-report diet instrument for a particular study by outlining the key features, benefits, and drawbacks of several instruments. The primer also covers key concepts in dietary assessment, explains how to minimize measurement error, and lists other dietary assessment resources.

The Dietary Assessment Primer contains details on the major self-report instruments and guidance for using these instruments alone or in combination to address different research questions. It also contains recommendations for choosing a dietary assessment approach in research settings requiring group-level estimates.
