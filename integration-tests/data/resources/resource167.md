This resource provides access to compound sensitivity data for approximately 500 compounds including FDA-approved anticancer drugs and investigational agents  on 63 established human small cell lung cancer cell lines in 9-point concentration response with an exposure time of 4 days.  These data, along with gene expression data derived from Affymatrix exon arrays and microRNA expression determined from Nanostring technology, are available at the website listed below. This study has been published ([J Natl Cancer Inst.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27247353) 2016 May 31;108(10).doi: 10.1093; [Cancer Med.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28766886) 2017 Aug;6(8):1952-1964. doi: 10.1002).
