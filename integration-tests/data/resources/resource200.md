The Pesticide-Exposure Matrix is designed to be used in conjunction with self-reported information about the types of pests that were treated in a person's home or garden. ([Example questionnaire](https://dceg.cancer.gov/tools/design/pesticide/pesticide-example-questionnaire))   The matrix covers four distinct time periods (1976, 1980, 1990, and 2000), two categories of pesticide appliers (consumers, using products purchased in retail stores, and professional applicators such as pest control operators and lawn services), and 12 types of pests.Its derivation is described in full in Colt J, Cyr MJ, Zahm SH, Tobias GS, Hartge P. 2006.
