description: >
  The CMR documents previous data harmonization efforts. Variables from many cohorts can be searched and compared for harmonization schemas. The CMR contains only metadata and no individual-level data.

The CMR is a tool that documents data harmonization across cohorts. Centralizing this information should reduce the labor-intensive effort of harmonization for future pooling projects. The CMR includes brief descriptions of the cohort studies and the data collected to provide context for harmonization along with the algorithms used to create the harmonized variables.

Variables from each cohort included can be searched and compared to determine if harmonization is possible. Once harmonization has occurred, the harmonized variables and the specifications used to create the variables are requested to be documented in the CMR. The CMR contains only metadata (variable names, formats, codes, descriptions) and no individual-level data.
