GenePattern is a genomic analysis platform that provides access to hundreds of tools for the analysis and visualization of multiple data types. A web-based interface provides easy access to these tools and allows the creation of multi-step analysis pipelines that enable reproducible in silico research. A new GenePattern Notebook environment allows users to combine GenePattern analyses with text, graphics, and code to create complete reproducible research narratives.
