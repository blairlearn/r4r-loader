The registry promotes the consistent use of common measures and research methods across childhood obesity research and prevention programs at the individual, community, and population levels. Each study in the registry contains information on study design, how to use the measure, and validity and reliability information. It was developed by the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research, and NCI staff are the project leads for the development and maintenance of the Measures Registry.
