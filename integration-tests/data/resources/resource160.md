CTD^2 researchers at the University of California, San Francisco developed a modified  CRISPR/dCas9 system. Catalytically inactive dCas9 enables modular and programmable RNA-guided genome regulation in eukaryotes. The CRISPR/dCas9 system has several advantages.  It enables robust gene interference (CRISPRi) or activation (CRISPRa) in human cells, allows specific knockdown with minimal off-target effects in human cells,  works efficiently in human and yeast cells, and does not cause double-strand breaks.
