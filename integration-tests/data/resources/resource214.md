The NCI Tobacco Control Monograph Series provides ongoing and timely information about emerging public health issues in smoking and tobacco control. The series reduces the time between availability of information from research projects and the publication and wide dissemination of this information, and it enhances the rapidity with which NCI can use findings from research trials to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality. Monographs 1â€“22 are available online to download and hard copies can be ordered free of charge.
