D3Oncoprint is a standalone software program used to visualize and dynamically explore annotated genomic mutation files. D3Oncoprint provides access to curated variants lists from CIViC, My Cancer Genome, and FDA-approved drug indication listings to facilitate the use of genomic data for biomedical discovery and application. D3Oncoprint also includes curated gene lists to explore commonly investigated biological processes (e.g., BioCarta pathways, FoundationOne cancer panels). Our software provides a flexible environment to dynamically explore the variant mutation profiles provided as input. The focus on interactive visualization with biological and medical annotation significantly lowers the barriers between complex genomic data biomedical investigators. We hope that this resource provides an important means of empowering researchers to translate the information from the collected data sets to biological insights and clinical applications.
