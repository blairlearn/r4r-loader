Managed by NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS), CDISC to develop and support controlled terminology for all CDISC foundational standards:

**SDTM** - SDTM is an international standard for clinical research data and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a standard electronic submission format. CDISC Questionnaires, Ratings, and Scales terminology is included in the SDTM terminology publication.

**CDASH** - CDISC leads the CDASH project, which develops clinical research study content standards in collaboration with 16 partner organizations, including NCI. CDASH terminology is a subset of SDTM terminology.

**ADaM** - CDISC leads the ADaM project, which supports efficient generation, replication, review, and submission of analysis results from clinical trial data.

**Define-XML** - CDISC leads the Define-XML terminology project, which defines the enumeration values found within the CDISC Define-XML data exchange standard. NCI EVS maintains and distributes Define-XML controlled terminology as part of NCI Thesaurus. More information is available at CDISC's Define-XML webpage.

**SEND** - CDISC leads the SEND project, which guides the organization, structure, and format of standard nonclinical tabulation datasets for interchange between organizations such as sponsors and CROs and for submission to a regulatory authority such as FDA. NCI EVS maintains and distributes SEND controlled terminology as part of NCI Thesaurus. More information is available at CDISC's SEND webpage.

**Protocol Terminology** - CDISC leads the Protocol Terminology project, which develops the semantics for commonly used research protocol entities. This project supports CDISC foundational standards for the Protocol Representation Model (PRM) and Clinical Trial Registry XML (CTR-XML).

**CDISC Glossary** - CDISC leads the Glossary project, which harmonizes definitions (including acronyms, abbreviations, and initials) used in the various standards initiatives undertaken by CDISC in clinical research. The glossary also serves the community of clinical researchers by selecting and defining terms pertaining to clinical research sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry or a federal agency.
