NCI created the NCEF to provide cancer researchers with access to the latest cryo-EM technology for high resolution imaging, particularly researchers in academic labs to who do not have adequate access to these instruments. NCEF currently houses one Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Falcon II direct detector and a K2 Summit direct detector at the end of a Gatan imaging filter.
