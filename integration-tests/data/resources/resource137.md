TARGET is a comprehensive molecular characterization initiative that utilizes state-of-the-art genomics tools to identify molecular changes that drive childhood cancers, including hematologic and solid tumors. The TARGET Data Matrix contains whole-genome and transcriptomic sequencing of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, kidney tumors, neuroblastomas, and osteosarcoma pediatric cancer types. Researchers can access up to four levels of data, from primary through higher level summary data for the molecular platform employed. To protect the privacy of patients, some clinical and genetic data require approval to access through NCBIâ€™s database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP; <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap>).
