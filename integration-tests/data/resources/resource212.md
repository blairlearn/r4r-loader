C-TUQ asks cancer patients and survivors about their tobacco use through a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire, available in both short and extended form, can be used at study entry and during follow-up. Domains include cigarette smoking history and current use, use relative to cancer diagnosis and treatment, other tobacco product use, cessation, and second-hand exposure. The questionnaire is available in English and Spanish. C-TUQ was designed and validated by the NCI-American Association of Cancer Research Cancer Patient Tobacco Use Assessment Task Force. It can help yield important research variables and allow harmonization across studies.
