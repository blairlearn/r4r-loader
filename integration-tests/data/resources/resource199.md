Exploring LD across ancestral populations is a powerful approach for investigating population-specific genetic structure as well as functionally mapping regions of disease susceptibility. LDlink applications allow users to easily and efficiently interrogate LD in population groups. LDlink consists of four modules for interactively exploring linkage disequilibrium: LDhap, LDmatrix, LDpair, and LDproxy. Modules are designed with an emphasis on ease of use, query flexibility, and interactive visualization of results. Haplotype tables and interactive plots generated by LDlink are tailored for investigators interested in mapping common and uncommon disease susceptibility loci with a focus on linking correlated alleles and highlighting potentially functional variants.
