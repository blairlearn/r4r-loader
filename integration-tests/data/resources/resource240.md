Regulatory documents for selected IND agents, including manfacturing procedures and non-clinical data. A subset of the documents filed for the INDs is being made available to the research community to implement routine synthesis of tracers at their own facilities and to assist investigators with the filing of their own INDs. Documents for several imaging agents are currently available.
