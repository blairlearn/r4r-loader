This resource provides access to compound sensitivity data for approximately 450 compounds, including FDA-approved anticancer drugs and investigational agents on established adult and pediatric sarcoma cell lines .These data, along with gene expression data derived from Affymatrix exon arrays and microRNA expression determined from Nanostring technology, are available from the Sarcoma Project Data website.
