Functional proteomics is the large-scale study of functional activity (e.g., expression, modificatins, etc.) of the proteins. TCPA is a comprehensive resource of cancer proteomics datasets mainly consisting of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) tumor tissue sample sets. This resource provides a unique opportunity to validate the findings from TCGA data and identify model cell lines for functional investigation. TCPA currently provides six modules: Summary, My Protein, Download, Visualization, Analysis, and Cell Line.
