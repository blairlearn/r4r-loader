Usual dietary intake is the long-run average daily intake of a nutrient or food. The concept of long-term average daily intake, or "usual intake," is important because dietary recommendations are intended to be met over time and diet-health hypotheses are based on dietary intakes over the long term. The NCI method can be used to estimate the distribution of usual intake for a population or subpopulation; assess the effects of individual covariates on consumption; and predict individual intake for use in a model to assess the relationship between diet and disease or other variable using the statistical technique of regression calibration.
