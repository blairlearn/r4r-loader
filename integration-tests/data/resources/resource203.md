DCTD sponsors the majority of extramural treatment trials at NCI. Sponsorship or support of clinical trials includes funding, regulatory support, and/or agent distribution. 

Oncologists, nurses, pharmacists, research administrators, and data managers should find the information in this handbook useful in practical matters connected with protocol drafting and submissions, reporting requirements, agent accountability, and a host of other subjects. This handbook is written to guide the individual clinical investigator at the clinical trial site working alongside a team of health professionals and research staff.
