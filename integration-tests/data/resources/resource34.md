This publication outlines the operational, technical, ethical, legal, and policy best practices for NCI-supported biospecimen resources. NCI Best Practices incorporate key principles that define state-of-the-science biospecimen resource practices, promote biospecimen and data quality, and support adherence to ethical and legal requirements. This document is based on current published information and will be revised periodically as new information is generated from ongoing research projects. While adoption of the NCI Best Practices is voluntary, NCI believes that these principles optimize biospecimens for cancer research.

This revision was published in March 2016.
