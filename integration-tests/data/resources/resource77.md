title: Small Area Estimates for Cancer-Related Measures
description: >
  This interactive website provides access to several small area estimation projects pertaining to risk factors. Model-based methods that combine information from one or two large-scale national surveys and multiple related sources have been developed to produce state or county-level estimates for a number of measures.

This interactive website provides access to several small area estimation projects conducted by the National Cancer Institute. Model-based methods that combine information from one or two large-scale national surveys and multiple related sources have been developed to produce state or county-level estimates for a number of measures. The cancer-related measures included in the website pertain to risk factors (e.g., smoking prevalence), screening behaviors, tobacco use and policies (e.g., smoke-free laws), and knowledge (e.g., estimates for variables included in the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)). The user may choose to display the estimates in a geographic map or in a table.
