title: RAS-Dependent Mouse Cell Lines
description: >
  The NCI RAS Initiative has developed 11 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines that are completely dependent on single ectopic wild-type or mutant RAS genes or a mutant *BRAF* gene.

The NCI RAS Initiative has developed mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines without any RAS genes. Their ability to proliferate has been rescued with wild-type *HRAS*, *NRAS*, *KRAS 4A*, or *KRAS 4B* genes or mutant *KRAS 4B* G12D, G12C, G12V, G13D, Q61L, or Q61R genes, or a mutant *BRAF* V600E gene. The parental cell line was the kind gift of Professor Mariano Barbacid.
