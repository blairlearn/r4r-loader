The International Registry of Werner Syndrome is the primary repository of samples and data from patients with Werner Syndrome (WS), and was established in 1988 as part of an objective to positionally clone the WS gene.    The registry ascertains and genotypes new pedigree cases from around the world, using lymphoblastoids and/or fibroblasts from human research participants, and provides genetic confirmation of classical WS. It also establishes and cryopreserves cell lines and other material from these pedigrees (both affected patients and their clinically unaffected siblings), including Epstein-Barr transformed peripheral blood B lymphocytes, primary skin fibroblasts, immortalized skin fibroblasts, WRN cDNA constructs, and others. All these materials are available for research.
