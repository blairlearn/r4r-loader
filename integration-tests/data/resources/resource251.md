PGDI is an open-access resource for identifying and locating genomic datasets that can be used to further the understanding of childhood cancers and develop better treatment protocols for sick children. This resource lists ongoing and completed molecular characterization projects of pediatric cancer cohorts from the United States and other countries, along with some basic details and reference metadata.
