SEER\*Explorer is a new interactive website that provides easy access to a wide range of SEER cancer statistics. It provides detailed statistics for a cancer site by gender, race, calendar year, age, and for a selected number of cancer sites, by stage and histology. Users can create custom graphs and tables, download data and images, share links to results, and (coming soon) download SEER\*Stat sessions.
