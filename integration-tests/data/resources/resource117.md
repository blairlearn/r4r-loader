NCI partnered with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) to fund the construction and management of a state-of-the-art macromolecular crystallography synchrotron beamline for determining structures of biologically important macromolecules. The beamline, known as the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and National Cancer Institute Collaborative Access Team (GM/CA CAT), is located at the Advanced Photon Source on the grounds of the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago. NCI has a significant amount of beamtime dedicated for the use of its grantees. Investigators interested in taking experiments to this facility should contact the beamline directly or email Dr. J. Randy Knowlton (Jk339o@nih.gov) for additional information.
