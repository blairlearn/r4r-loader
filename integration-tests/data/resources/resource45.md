title: S-PLUS Program for the Analysis of Accelerated Titration Design
description: >
    The S-PLUS Program includes new "accelerated titration designs" for phase I clinical trials, along with a dose–toxicity model which can be used to evaluate the toxicity data. The dose–toxicity model can be used by investigators conducting phase I studies to assign the phase II starting dose.

The program fits the design model (y<sub>ij</sub> = log(d<sub>ij</sub> + a×D<sub>ij</sub>) + b<sub>i</sub> + e<sub>ij</sub>) and provides maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters along with the confidence intervals. This allows estimation of the dose-toxicity curve.
