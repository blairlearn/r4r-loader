The objectives of COMETS are to provide a framework to foster international collaborations among studies sharing common objectives; provide a forum for the discussion, development, and pursuit of new collaborative studies and research directions; support the development of early-career researchers; and advance the knowledge of metabolomics profiles associated with chronic disease phenotypes to improve our understanding of prediction of disease etiology, diagnosis, and prognosis.

Cohorts must be prospective and have 100+ participants with blood metabolomics data; have identified metabolite data; and have follow-up for disease, including cancer and non-cancer outcomes.
