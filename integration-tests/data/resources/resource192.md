Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and precision oncology. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. rDriver predicts driver mutations by integrating genome-wide mRNA/protein expression levels with evolutionary  and structural properties of mutations characterized by functional impact scores.
