The BMEG is a cancer data integration platform that utilizes methods collected from DREAM challenges and applied to large datasets, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, and makes them available for analysis using a high performance graph database. DREAM challenges are crowdsourcing challenges designed to evaluate model predictions and pathway inference algorithms in systems biology and medicine.
