Genetic simulation software is an important adjunct to research in genetic epidemiology and statistical genetics. The GSR provides a catalogue of more than 100 existing software packages that simulate genetic data of the human genome. The purpose of the GSR is to help investigators identify the genetic simulator most suitable for their research needs. 

The GSR characterizes applications by many different attributes, including simulation method, type of genetic variation, input/output formats, programming languages, and license information.
