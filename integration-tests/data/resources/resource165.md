The NExT program assists translation to the clinic of novel therapeutic interventions, either synthetic, natural product, or biologic, arising from academic, private, or government entities. NExT is not a grant mechanism. Approved proposals gain access to [drug discovery resources](https://next.cancer.gov/discoveryResources/default.htm) and [development resources](https://next.cancer.gov/developmentResources/default.htm) through the NExT Program. A panel of experts will evaluate the applications based on criteria including scientific merit, feasibility, alignment with NCIâ€™s mission, novelty, and clinical need.
