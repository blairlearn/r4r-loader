The *TP53* database is meant to be a source of information on *TP53* variants for a broad range of scientists and clinicians who work in different research areas including basic research, pathology, epidemiology, and genetics. The *TP53* Database compiles various types of data and information from the literature and generalist databases on human *TP53* gene variations related to cancer. The data available include functional/structural data, somatic variants, germline variants, cell lines, mouse models, and experimentally induced variants.
