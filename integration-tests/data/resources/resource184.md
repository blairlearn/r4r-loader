DHQ III is the most recent version of the DHQ and it can be used by researchers, clinicians, or educators to assess food and dietary supplement intakes. DHQ III is available as a web-based tool only. There are four DHQ III questionnaires, available in both English and Spanish, that vary by time frame and inclusion of portion size questions. There have been two prior versions of DHQ, the original and DHQ II. There were Canadian and U.S. versions of the DHQ II, but the most recent iteration, DHQ III, does not yet have a Canadian version. DHQ II-Canada is still available for use.
