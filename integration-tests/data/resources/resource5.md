The CDSA is a web-based platform to support the sharing, management, and analysis of digital pathology data. Emory University  currently hosts over 23,000 images from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the software is being developed within the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) grant to be deployable as a digital pathology platform for other labs and cancer institutes.
