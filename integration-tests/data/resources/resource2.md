NG-CHMs are interactive heat maps of multiple tumor types and multiple data types profiled by TCGA.  The NG-CHM tool enables users to zoom and pan across the heatmap, alter its color scheme, generate production-quality PDFs, and link out from rows, columns, and individual heatmap entries to related statistics, databases, and other information. The maps provide an exploratory environment invaluable for identifying cancer sub-types or investigating genes or pathways of interest.
