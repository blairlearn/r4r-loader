The TCGA Clinical Explorer is a web and mobile interface for identifying clinical - genomic driver associations. The Clinical Explorer interface provides a platform to query TCGA data using the following methods: 1) searching for clinically relevant genes, microRNAs, and proteins by name, cancer types, or clinical parameters, 2) searching for genomic and/or proteomic profile changes by clinical parameters, or 3) testing two-hit hypotheses.
