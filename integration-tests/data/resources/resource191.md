The NCI TPW integrates cell-line sensitivity data for 15 clinically relevant anticancer agents with both basal transcript levels and agent-induced transcriptional changes for 12,704 genes at three time points across the NCI-60 panel. The NCI TPW further relates this information to exon mutation, protein expression, and multidrug resistance data and enables query of these data in the context of cellular pathways and receptors. This website has been developed using advanced computational and visualization tools for empowering developmental-therapeutics investigators worldwide and providing them access to the genome-wide characterization of the NCI-60 cell lines and the enormous timeâ€“course databases on genome-wide response to treatment with drugs.
