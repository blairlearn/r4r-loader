The GWAS Explorer PLCO Atlas is as an interactive tool to facilitate data sharing and enables researchers to search for, visualize, and download aggregated association results from the PLCO genome-wide association analyses (GWAS). The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Study was a large population-based randomized trial to determine the effects of screening on cancer-related mortality and secondary endpoints in men and women aged 55 to 74. The Atlas includes genotype data of 110,562 PLCO subjects with 200+ phenotypes collected from questionnaires, medical records, cancer registries, and the National Death Index. Descriptive characteristics, annotation of phenotypes, and links to other pertinent genomic resources are available.
