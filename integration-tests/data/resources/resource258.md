title: Activities Completed over Time in 24 hours (ACT24)
description: >
  Activities Completed over Time in 24 hours (ACT24) is a free, web-based tool for epidemiologic, interventional, behavioral, or clinical research on energy expenditure. ACT24 estimates daily summary values for physical activity and sedentary behavior, including time spent sitting and in different types and intensities of physical activity, based on previous-day recall reporting from participants.

Activities Completed over Time in 24 hours (ACT24) is a free, web-based tool to estimate daily summary values for physical activity and sedentary behavior, including time spent sitting and in different types and intensities of physical activity. ACT24 has been validated in studies of middle-aged and older adults and has been used to provide detailed portraits of human time use and energy expenditure at the population level. Researchers can register their projects, generate custom logins for participants to enter data via a secure participant site, and download data. An Application Programming Interface (API) is available to link ACT24 data to study management systems.
