Since 2003, NCI’s HINTS has tracked changes in the rapidly evolving health communication and information technology landscape. A biennial, cross-sectional survey, it collects nationally representative data about the American public’s knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of cancer- and health-related information. It has enabled a growing body of research that evaluates the effects of health communication, media, and health information technology on health and behavioral outcomes, health care quality, and health disparities.

HINTS can be used to understand how adults use different communication channels to access and use health information; to obtain information about how cancer risks are perceived; and to create more effective health communication strategies across different populations.
