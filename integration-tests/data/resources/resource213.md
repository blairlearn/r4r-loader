Since 1992, the TUS-CPS has served as a key source of national, state, and sub-state data on tobacco use behavior, attitudes, and policies in the United States. The TUS is conducted every 3-4 years as part of the CPS, a monthly survey conducted by the US Census Bureau for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. In each cycle, TUS-CPS collects nationally representative data from about 240,000 adults (data collected between 1992-2006 also included youth ages 15-17). About two-thirds of respondents complete the questionnaire by telephone and responses for the remaining third are obtained through in-person interviews. The survey is regularly conducted in English and Spanish, and other languages when needed. These data can be used by researchers to monitor tobacco control progress, conduct tobacco-related research, including tobacco health disparities, and evaluate tobacco control programs.
