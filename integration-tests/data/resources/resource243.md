Splice site variants are one of the well-known classes of genetic alterations playing an important role in biology. Splice site mutations in cancer are most frequently observed as inactivating alterations in tumor suppressor genes (e.g., *TP53* or *RB1*) and to a lesser degree as activating alterations in oncogenes (e.g., *MET*). Interpreting the consequences of a specific splice site variant is not straightforward, especially if the variant is located outside of the canonical splice sites. Accurate interpretation of a splice site mutation’s impact can further our understanding of biology, influence patient treatment, and in case of germline splice site variants, may have relevance to familial disease predisposition. To facilitate the interpretation of splice site variant effects, the Biometric Research Program’s Computational and Systems Biology Branch developed MutSpliceDB: a database of splice sites variants, documenting variants effect(s) on splicing based on RNA-seq BAM files from sample(s) with splice site variants.
