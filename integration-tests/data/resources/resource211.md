The goal of CTEP is to facilitate the process of bringing promising, novel investigational anticancer and anti-HIV agents to the public as quickly and as safely as possible. CTEP offers a unique combination of resources and expertise to assist an industry collaborator in clinical development of new therapeutic agents and the ability to evaluate investigational agents in a wide variety of tumor types and disease settings. These guidelines provide information regarding the process for co-developing an investigational anticancer agent with NCI. In addition, there are links to other online resources to assist with technology development, clinical development resources, and small business research funding.
