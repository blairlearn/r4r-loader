A major challenge of the large-scale siRNA and shRNA loss-of fucntion screens is off-target effects resulting from short regions (~6 nucleotides) of oligonucleotide complementary  to many different mRNAs. DecoRNAi is a computational approach that could be used for identification and correction of the off-target effects from primary screening data.
