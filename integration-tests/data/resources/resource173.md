Assessment of occupational exposures in case-control studies has traditionally been limited because of the lack of information on the variability of exposures across and within jobs. NCI has developed special questionnaires with modules designed to obtain detailed information for over 40 specific jobs on tasks, work practices, chemicals, equipment, engineering controls, personal protective equipment and indirect exposures. Examples of jobs for which questionnaires have been developed include : plumbers, roofers, steel workers, packagers, inspectors, and painters. A wide variety of exposures are addressed including: solvents, metals, EMF, PCBs, and wood dust.
