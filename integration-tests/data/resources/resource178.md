The NCI Mouse Repository is a resource for mouse cancer models and associated strains that is available to all members of the scientific community (academic, non-profit, and commercial). NCI Mouse Repository strains are cryo-archived and distributed as frozen germoplasm (embryos and/or sperm). The repository also contains 1,501 genetically engineered mouse embryonic stem cells harboring conditional microRNA (miRNA) transgenes that can be used to study the role of miRNAs in cancer.
