BRB-ArrayTools was developed by professional statisticians experienced in the analysis of microarray data and involved in the development of improved methods for the design and analysis of microarray-based experiments. The analytic and visualization tools are integrated into Excel as an add-in. The analytic and visualization tools themselves are developed in the powerful R statistical system, in C and Fortran programs, and in Java applications. Visual Basic for Applications is the glue that integrates the components and hides the complexity of the analytic methods from the user. The system incorporates a variety of powerful analytic and visualization tools developed specifically for microarray data analysis.
