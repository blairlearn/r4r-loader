Statistics are presented as graphs and tables. The tool provides incidence and mortality rates. Users have the option to select long-term trends and build their own graphs and/or tables. This resource is eventually going to be replaced by SEER*Explorer, another interactive tool that includes survival and other statistics in addition to incidence and mortality.
