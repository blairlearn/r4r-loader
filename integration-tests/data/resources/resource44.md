We fit a stochastic model to data from 20 phase I trials of 9 different drugs. We then simulated new data from the model with the parameters estimated from the actual trials and evaluated the performance of alternative phase I designs on this simulated data. Four designs were evaluated. Accelerated titration designs appear to effectively reduce the number of patients under-treated, speed the completion of phase I trials, and provide a substantial increase in the information obtained. The downloadable Excel dose-level assignment program can be used for accelerated titration design for phase I clinical trial.
