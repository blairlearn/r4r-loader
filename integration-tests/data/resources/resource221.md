CSSI sponsors a diverse array of projects related to new technologies, standards, and preanalytical variables. Integrated management of the datasets across projects makes the data more accessible and usable by the cancer research community. The CSSI Data Coordinating Center (CSSI DCC) stores and manages access to data generated by cancer research funded or supported by NCI. This data is in the standard Investigation-Study-Assay tab-delimited format (ISA-TAB) format, which describes a scientific investigation, its study or studies, and assay data. The CSSI DCC Portal is a public repository of experiment-related information describing cancer research investigations. The portal can be used to browse, search, and access data generated through NCI-funded projects and other user-uploaded datasets.
