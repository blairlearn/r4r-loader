HCMIâ€™s cancer type-specific CRFs have been developed through collaborations with international clinical experts and the clinical data elements have been standardized through the Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR). The Enrollment CRF data are collected at the patient index date, which includes initial pathologic diagnosis, sample procurement, or first patient visit. The Follow-up CRF data are collected at least 3 months after enrollment data collection following cancer model establishment. As the tumor types modeled through the HCMI are constantly updated, be sure to check back regularly for additional or updated CRFs.
