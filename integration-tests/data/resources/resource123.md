title: Detecting Mechanism of Action based Network Dysregulation (DeMAND)
description: >
  DeMAND is an R-system algorithm that elucidates mechanisms of action of cellular perturbations (e.g., small molecule) by analyzing network dysregulations.

The DeMAND algorithm predicts drug mechanisms of action using gene expression data generated from control and perturbed cells. The data are then used to identify network dysregulation to determine both the interactions and the genes that are involved in the mechanism of action.
