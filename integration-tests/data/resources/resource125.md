This website provides tables and graphs showing cancer prevalence and costs of cancer care projected through 2020. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data for incidence and survival in combination with Census data, the website has prevalence information by cancer site as well as for all sites combined. It also uses Medicare data to calculate the annualized mean net costs of care per patient. Users can see how much cancer care for each type costs the nation as a whole. Graphs have features such as breakdowns by phase of treatment as well.
