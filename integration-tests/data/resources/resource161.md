SlicerDMRI is an open-source project to improve and extend diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) software in 3D Slicer that allows users to load Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and nrrd/nhdr diffusion MRI medical image data; perform tractography and compute scalar maps, such as FA; and load and save tractography in new DICOM format. Users can also visualize, edit, and register multimodal data using 3D Slicer tools. All functionality is accesible through the graphical user interface, but users may also perform command line batch processing.
