The OncoPPi Portal facilitates discovery of new mechanisms to conrtol tumorigenesis through integration of genomic, pharmacological, clinical, and structural data with the network of cancer-associated protein–protein interactions (PPI) experimentally determined in cancer cells. This is an interactive web resource that allows users to access, explore, and prioritize cancer-relevant PPIs for target discovery.
