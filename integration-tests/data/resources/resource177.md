The CPTAC Assay Portal is a repository of highly characterized proteomic assays, standard operating procedures, and assay characterization/validation data in support of the National Institutes of Health’s Rigor and Reproducibility Principles and Guidelines. Upon entering the assay portal, users can search for an assay by entering a protein or peptide name, or they can filter assays by selecting the drop-down tab on the left side of the page. Each assay has background information along with a protein map, assay details, publication information, assay parameters, chromatograms, response curves, and repeatability measures. Additional resources include the standard operating procedures and instructions for viewing the peptide or protein in Panorama.
