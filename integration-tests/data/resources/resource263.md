TREAT (version 0.0.5) is an R package for detecting complex joint effects in case-control studies. The test statistic is derived from a tree-structure model by recursive partitioning the data. The ultra-fast algorithm is designed to evaluate the significance of association between candidate gene and disease outcome.
