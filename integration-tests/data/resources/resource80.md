The SEER Research Data include SEER incidence and population data associated by age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, and geographic areas (including SEER registry and county). Use of these data for publication purposes should contain a citation which includes submission and release dates. Cancer researchers use these data to analyze trends and conduct studies. Data come from SEER registries, which are population-based registries that maintain high data quality. The SEER Program now covers approximately 48% of the US population, including significant representation across racial/ethnic groups.
