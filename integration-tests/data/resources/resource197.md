Published monthly and managed by NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS), the NCI Thesaurus, reference terminology and biomedical ontology is used in a growing number of NCI and other systems.

The NCIt provides definitions, synonyms, and other information on more than 10,000 cancers and related diseases, 17,000 single agents and related substances, combination therapies, a federal Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) standard anatomy section, and a wide range of other topics related to cancer and biomedical research. It is maintained by a multidisciplinary team of editors, who add about 700 new entries each month.
