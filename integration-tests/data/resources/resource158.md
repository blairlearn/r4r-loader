OC is a collection of validated, expression-ready, full-length open reading frames for most of the currently defined human genes. Open reading frames are the protein-coding sequences of genes.)The international ORFeome Collaboration  was founded to provide the research community with a comprehensive set of full-length, high quality human ORF clones  in the Gateway cloning system ready to use for recombinant protein expression. The collection currently covers more than 17,000 RefSeq and Ensembl genes with more than 29,000 clones . All OC clones are fully sequence verified and annotated.
