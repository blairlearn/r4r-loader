CTB is an international collaborative project that is supported by NCIâ€™s Division of Cancer Biology and the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation of Japan with active participation from Russia and Ukraine, two countries heavily affected by the 1986 Chernobyl accident. CTB manages biospecimen resources and associated data sets that support studies on the biology of thyroid cancer, the major health consequence of the Chernobyl accident.
