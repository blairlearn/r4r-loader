The MCLP Data Portal is an interactive resource of proteomic, genomic, transcriptomic, and drug screening data of a large number of cancer cell lines. Protein expression levels (proteoimc) were measured using the reverse phase protein array platform. The MCLP platform provides four interactive modules: My Protein, Analysis, Visualization, and Data Sets.
