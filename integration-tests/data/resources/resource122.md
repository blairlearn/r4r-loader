PiHelper integrates drug target and antibody target interactions from publicly available resources to facilitate research in systems pharmacology, perturbation biology, and proteomics. PiHelper can (1) import drug and antibody target information; (2) search the interactions; (3) visualize data interactively in a network; and (4) export interaction data for use in publications or other analysis tools.
