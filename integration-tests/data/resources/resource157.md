title: Reagents Available to NCI-funded Researchers
description: >
  The Tumor Microenvironment Network (TMEN) generated a number of resources that are now available to NCI-funded cancer researchers. These resources include EHS (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm) sarcoma-derived laminin rich matrix; novel antibodies to detect cancer stem cells and stromal cells; human xenograft tumor bank with characterized stem cell populations; bone marrow-derived cells from donor mice; and RCAS Constructs.
