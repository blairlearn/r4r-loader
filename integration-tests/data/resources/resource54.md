CISNET is a consortium of NCI-sponsored investigators who use statistical and simulation modeling to examine the potential impacts of prevention, screening, and treatment on cancer incidence and mortality. These models can then project future trends and help determine optimal cancer control strategies. These models can also be used to guide public health research and priorities. Established in 2000, CISNET comprises nine cancer site groups: breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, cervical, gastric, uterine, bladder, and multiple myeloma. Many of the resources generated by the CISNET consortium are freely available on the website. Additionally, CISNET invites inquiries from outside groups regarding collaborations on cancer control issues that are amenable to modeling.
