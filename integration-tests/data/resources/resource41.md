Targeted design randomizes only marker-positive patients to a treatment arm. Untargeted design does not measure the marker and randomizes all who otherwise are eligible. By inputting the probability of response for control arm, the proportion of patients who are classifier positive, the improvement in response probability for new treatment in classifier positive patients, the Improvement in response probability for new treatment in classifier negative patients, two-sided significance level, and power, this program calculates the total number of patients for untargeted design and randomized targeted design, as well as total number of patients screened for targeted design.
