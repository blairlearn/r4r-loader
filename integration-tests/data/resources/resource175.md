title: Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) Data Portal
description: >
  CPTAC analyzes cancer biospecimens by mass spectrometry, characterizing and quantifying their constituent proteins, or proteome. The CPTAC Data Portal is the centralized repository for the dissemination of proteomic data collected by the Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs).

The Data Portal hosts the mass spectrometry data from the CPTAC program. A key component is the proteogenomic profiling of patient tumors, such as those from the breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancer programs in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The portal also hosts data from completed programs and external studies.
The CPTAC program is the main data generator of the hosted data. Additional datasets from other programs such as APOLLO and ICPC are anticipated in the future.
