SWNE uses Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to decompose datasets into latent biological factors, and embeds these factors, cells, and genes in a two-dimensional visualization. Visualization captures the local and global structure in continuous and discrete high-dimensional single-cell genomics datasets and adds biological context. This method creates an accurate, context-rich map of the datasets and enables biological interpretation of the data.
