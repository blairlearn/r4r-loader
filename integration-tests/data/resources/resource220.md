title: Differential Allelic Cis-regulatory Effects-scan (DACRE-scan)
description: >
  DACRE-scan is a statistical tool that deconvolutes and integrates tumor DNA and RNA profiles from matched whole-exome and whole-transcriptome tissue sequencing data. This tool is being used to discover functional variants (somatic and germline) that are subject to differential allelic cis-regulatory effects.
