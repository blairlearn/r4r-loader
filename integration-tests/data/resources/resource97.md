title: Molecular Target Data
description: >
  The Molecular Targets effort is a collaboration between qualified researchers and the NCI  Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD). The NCI-60 lab will provide NCI-60 cell line frozen cell pellets, DNA, or RNA for analysis in the external researchersâ€™ labs.

Thousands of molecular targets have been measured in the NCI-60 human tumor cell lines. Measurements include protein levels, RNA measurements, mutation status and enzyme activity levels. Data sites allow searches for a target of interest, or a list of targets. The COMPARE program allows identification of targets or compounds with patterns that correlate with a target of interest.
