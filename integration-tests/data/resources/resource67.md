BioMuta is an annotated SNV and disease association database in which variations are mapped to positions at genome, protein, and gene levels. The current BioMuta database (BioMuta v3.0) contains a total of 4,684,236 nsSNVs reported in 18,269 genes across 77 Disease Ontology cancer types. A small number of variants were added to BioMuta following manual literature review of PubMed abstracts.
