title: Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP)
description: >
  CTRP is a resource of compound sensivity data (concentrationâ€“response curves) that can be mined to develop insights into small molecule mechanisms of action and novel therapeutic hypotheses.

CTRP hosts data that are generated by measuring cellular responses to an 'Informer Set' of small molecule probes and drugs. Users can mine for lineages or mutations enriched among cell lines sensitive to small molecules. By connecting cellular features to small molecule sensitivities, CTRP identifies new potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for different cancer types.
