The NCI PDMR is a repository of low passage patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), cell lines (PDCs), organoids (PDOrg), and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) available to investigators at both non-profit and for-profit institutions for a modest cost. The PDMR generates models from solid tumor histologies with a focus on complimenting existing publicly available models and filling in gaps where needed, for instance creating models for rare cancers (e.g., mesothelioma, Merkel cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, salivary gland cancer, and others).  Available models include clinical history and molecular characterization information so investigators can select models best fit to their research.  Researchers not interested in performing wet lab studies can mine the metadata associated with the models using the NCI PDMR database.
