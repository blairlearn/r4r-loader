The CI\*Rank website provides age-adjusted U.S. incidence and mortality rates by geographic region, plus the confidence intervals for those rates and their ranks. Results presented in CI*Rank help show the usefulness of ranks. For example, ranks for relatively rare diseases or less populated areas may be essentially meaningless because of their large variability, but ranks for more common diseases in densely populated regions can be very useful.
