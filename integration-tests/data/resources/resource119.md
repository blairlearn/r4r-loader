EDDY-CTRP provides analysis of subset of the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal (link is external) (CTRP) transcriptome and drug screening data from 810 cancer cell lines (link is external) was performed using the Evaluation of Differential DependencY (link is external) (EDDY) algorithm.This analysis identified pathways enriched for differential dependencies between sensitive and non-sensitive cell-lines to each compound as well as potential novel targets, termed "mediators".
