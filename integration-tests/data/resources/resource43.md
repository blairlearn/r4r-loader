OpenGeneMed is an informatics system to support clinical trial research. OpenGeneMed streamlines clinical trial management and it can be used by clinicians, lab personnel, statisticians, and other researchers as a communication hub. It automates the annotation of the genomic variants identified by sequencing, classifies the actionable mutations according to customizable rules, and facilitates quality control by the molecular characterization lab in the review of variants. OpenGeneMed collects baseline information of patients to determine eligibility for the panel of treatment regimens available. The system generates patient reports containing detected genomic alterations along with summarized information that can be used for treatment assignment by a supervising treatment review team.
