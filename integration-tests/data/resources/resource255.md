[HCMI Searchable Catalog](https://hcmi-searchable-catalog.nci.nih.gov/) is a continuously updated resource for querying the available next-generation models developed by HCMI. Within the catalog, users can search by patient demographics, tumor, and model elements including age at diagnosis, sex, treatment information, clinical tumor diagnosis, primary site, clinical stage, and type of model (e.g. 3D-organoid, 2D-conditionally reprogrammed cells), etc. The links to model-associated clinical and molecular data stored at the [Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://gdc.cancer.gov) and the 3rd party model distributor are available within each model-specific page.
