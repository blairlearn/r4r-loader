The CCDI MTP is a knowledge base that extracts, organizes, annotates, and links to data on childhood cancers. This tool allows researchers to browse and identify associations between molecular targets, diseases, and drugs and can be used for systematic identification and prioritization of the pediatric molecular target list. This tool allows comparisons of childhood datasets with tabular and graphic visualizations of genomic data and facilitates prioritization of targets by reducing the time spent monitoring and organizing scientific and medical literature.
