The Catalogue of Surveillance Systems provides a platform to review, sort, and compare more than 100 surveillance systems relevant to childhood obesity research and evaluation of policy and environmental interventions. This resource helps researchers more easily investigate childhood obesity in America by increasing efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation in obesity research. It was developed by the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research, and NCI staff are the project leads for the development and maintenance of this tool.
