CanSurv uses information from SEER*Stat software. For grouped survival data, it can fit both the standard survival models and the mixture cure survival models and it provides various graphs for model diagnosis. It can also fit parametric (cure) survival models to individually-listed data. The most recent version of the software has new options that provide more flexibility for other programs to read the calculated results.
