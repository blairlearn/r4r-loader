The Team Science Toolkit is an interactive website that provides resources to help users manage, support, and conduct team-based research. It also provides resources for evaluating or studying team science. The Toolkit includes a user-generated collection of resources recommended by experts across disciplines; publicly available resources such as practical tools to enhance research collaboration, measures for studying team-based research, and recommended readings; and a platform to connect with colleagues and stay up to date on news and events.
